Effects

With the Effect "class", you can "tween" properties of objects or functions with different transitions
Its a port of the Mootools Fx classes.

Usage

Simple use (for tweening the opacity): 
see example-tweening-opacity.lua.

When using a function instead of an object it is important 
that the function can set and return your properties via a table.

Example (asuming you want to tween x and y of a client instance c):

	fx = Effect.create(function (geom) {
	  return c:geometry(geom)
	end
	fx:start({x = 10, y = 10})




My currently use
